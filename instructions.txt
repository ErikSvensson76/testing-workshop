Workshop instructions:
************************
I created a stub class called Rot13Converter and also a Rot13ConverterTest class in the test scope.
Rot13Converter.class has two methods

 public static char convertChar(char source){...}
     -> Should be able to take in a char and convert it according to the Rot13 cipher explained below

 public static String convertText(String source){...}
     -> Should be able to convert whole Strings back and forth.


About Rot13
************************
Rot13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that divides the alphabet in two parts.
This cipher has a long history. Read more about it here:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M
| | | | | | | | | | | | |
N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

a -> n
n -> a

m -> z
z -> m

Characters on top half i shift 13 steps forward
Characters on bottom half i shift 13 steps backwards

"hello" would translate to "uryyb"
ALSO
"uryyb" would translate back to "hello"
